experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for the community\nShowing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or

professional setting\n\nOur Responsibilities\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\nEnforcement\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at https://matrix.to/#/#nomacs:matrix.org. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.

You can either support us by:\n\ntranslating nomacs to your language\nporting nomacs to a system not yet supported (it should compile on every system that is supported by Qt)\ncoding (bug fixes &amp; additional features are always welcome)\n\nPlease see the How to Contribute page.\nHow to translate nomacs?\nHere is a short introduction how to translate nomacs to your language.\nDoes nomacs support Windows XP and/or Vista?\nThe answer is yes and no.\nSo neither Windows XP nor Vista are supported in future developments since nomacs 3.0.\nHowever, nomacs 2.4.6 is a pretty stable version which you can use on these operating systems.\nHow to make an unattended installation of nomacs?\nWhen using Windows you can make an unattended installation of nomacs:\n\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/docs/help/faq/","title":"FAQ"}},"docInfo":{"https://nomacs.org/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://nomacs.org/authors/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/authors/markus-diem/":{"body":3,"title":2},"https://nomacs.org/authors/stefan-fiel/":{"body":3,"title":2},"https://nomacs.org/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/contributing/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/":{"body":257,"title":2},"https://nomacs.org/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/":{"body":140,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/contributing/translation/":{"body":180,"title":2},"https://nomacs.org/docs/getting-started/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://nomacs.org/docs/getting-started/installation/":{"body":155,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":138,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/help/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://nomacs.org/docs/help/faq/":{"body":166,"title":1}},"length":14},"lang":"English"};
